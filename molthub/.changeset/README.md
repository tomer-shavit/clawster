# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started!

## Usage

### Creating a changeset

```bash
npm run changeset
```

### Versioning packages

```bash
npm run version-packages
```

### Publishing

```bash
npm run release
```

## Q. Do I have to use this?

No! You can use any versioning strategy you like. This is just a tool to help you.
