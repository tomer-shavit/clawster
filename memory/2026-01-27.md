# Daily Briefing Cron Fix

## Issue
- Tomer expected RSS briefing at 9 AM Israel time
- Cron job was configured but failing: `Error sending briefing: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'clawdbot'`

## Root Cause
- Script `/home/ubuntu/clawd/scripts/daily-tech-briefing.py` called `clawdbot` without full path
- Cron's environment doesn't include `/home/ubuntu/.npm-global/bin` in PATH
- Job ran at 7:00 UTC, generated briefing, but failed to send

## Fix
- Updated script line 186: `"clawdbot"` → `"/home/ubuntu/.npm-global/bin/clawdbot"`
- Manually ran script to send today's briefing
- Tomorrow's 9 AM briefing should work automatically

## Cron Schedule
```
30 7 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/ubuntu/clawd/scripts/daily-tech-briefing.py >> /home/ubuntu/clawd/logs/cron-briefing.log 2>&1
```
(9:30 AM Israel time = 7:30 UTC)

## RSS Sources
- Hacker News, TechCrunch, The Verge, Ars Technica
- Hugging Face (ML research), Google AI Blog, Distill
- VentureBeat, Product Hunt, AI News

## Notes
- Tomer wants research-heavy content, not marketing posts
- Filters for AI/ML and Startup/VC keywords
- Excludes: generic tech, consumer electronics, politics
