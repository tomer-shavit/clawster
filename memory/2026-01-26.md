# First Session with Tomer

## Event
- Date: 2026-01-26
- Tomer introduced himself in detail
- Updated core workspace files (IDENTITY.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md)

## Who Tomer Is
- Software engineer at Wix
- Builder with focus on: clean UX, real customer pain, production systems
- Technical DNA: reliability, deployment pipelines, logs, metrics, pragmatic architecture
- Wants root causes, not hand-wavy explanations

## AI Startup Direction
**Core thesis:** Help companies reduce AI spend (~80% in right scenarios) without users feeling any downgrade

**Current wedge:** Privacy-first, end-to-end migration service from proprietary LLM APIs → open-source models

**Product stack:**
1. Production data collection (workflow tagging, real traces)
2. Dataset curation dashboard (review, filter, label, dedupe)
3. One-click fine-tuning (PEFT/LoRA)
4. Managed GPU training (Modal, Together)
5. Evaluation & benchmarking (DeepEval backbone)
6. One-click deployment (Modal, Fireworks-style)

**Key design principles:**
- Uptime, latency, operational simplicity
- Privacy-first data capture
- Quality gates before deployment

## How He Works
- Product engineer mindset: UX → business outcome → architecture
- Skeptical of ideas that don't survive real-world constraints
- "Forcing-function clarity" — what breaks, who feels pain, what proves it
- Strong system design: clear APIs, idempotency, audit trails
- Developer experience matters: naming, clean primitives, fast iteration

## Communication Style
- Loves structure: tables, schemas, templates, checklists
- Concrete examples over abstractions
- Short, polished external messaging
- **ML learning:** Real mechanics (hypothesis, loss, optimization, regularization)
- Prefers explicit equations
- SVM: Lagrangian view, with/without kernel trick
- **Prefers 𝜆 for regularization** (not other symbols)

## Projects
- **Runline:** Emotional, design-led product
- **CVBoost:** AI-driven resume analysis (full-stack, hackathon winner)
- **AI startup:** In exploration phase, focused on migration service wedge

## Technical Stack
- **Languages:** Scala, Golang, JS/TS, Python, C/C++, Java
- **Frameworks:** React, Next.js, Node.js, Flask, Redux, Tailwind
- **Infra:** AWS (EC2, S3, SQS, SES), Azure (Serverless, App Insights), Docker, K8s
- **Data:** MongoDB, Redis, SQL
- **Tools:** Kafka, Grafana, Git
- **DevTools:** Cursor-style workflows

## Achievements
- 3x Hackathon Champion (HUJI-ASPER, Hebrew University, International Sick Solutions)
- Featured prominently on LinkedIn for CVBoost

## Notes for Future
- Tomer likes specificity and concrete examples
- When discussing ML: show the math (equations, not hand-wavy descriptions)
- Use 𝜆 for regularization
- Think like a product engineer: start from UX/outcome, back-solve to architecture
- Be skeptical of ideas that don't have real-world constraints
- When proposing solutions: show forcing-function clarity
