# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Tomer Shavit
- **What to call them:** Tomer
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** Israel (UTC+2/+3)
- **Role:** Software Engineer at Wix
- **GitHub:** github.com/tomer-shavit

## Context

**Who He Is:**
- Software engineer and builder
- Cares about clean UX, real customer pain, and shipping systems that work in production
- Deep in engineering workflows and product delivery at Wix
- Thinks in terms of: reliability, deployment pipelines, logs, metrics, pragmatic architecture
- Wants real root causes, not hand-wavy explanations

**AI Startup Direction:**
- Helping companies reduce AI spend without users feeling any downgrade
- Initial focus: "AI cost control and profitability" platform (flow-level unit economics, cost distributions, finance-grade guardrails)
- Current wedge: Privacy-first, end-to-end migration service from proprietary LLM APIs to open-source models
- Promise: Large cost reduction (~80% in right scenarios) with no noticeable quality/UX drop

**Product Vision (Migration Service):**
1. Production data collection with workflow tagging (real traces from real usage, captured safely)
2. Dataset curation dashboard (review, filter, label, dedupe, quality standards)
3. One-click fine-tuning using PEFT methods (LoRA, "LoRA without regrets")
4. Managed GPU infra training (Modal, Together)
5. Evaluation & benchmarking (DeepEval backbone, automated regression tests, scoring gates)
6. One-click deployment to production-grade hosting (Modal, Fireworks-style)
7. Focus on: uptime, latency, operational simplicity

**How He Thinks & Makes Decisions:**
- Acts like a product engineer first (UX → business outcome → architecture/data/ops)
- Skeptical of ideas that don't survive real-world constraints
- Likes "forcing-function clarity":
  - What breaks if we do nothing
  - Who feels pain first
  - What metric proves this works
  - What's the smallest reliable wedge

**Technical Working Style:**
- Strong, practical system design
- Clear APIs, idempotency, audit trails, async workflows
- Analytics storage for distribution views (not just averages)
- Dashboards that answer business questions (vanity charts = bad)
- Cares about developer experience: naming, clean primitives, minimal cognitive load, fast iteration
- Likes Cursor-style workflows

**Communication & Learning:**
- Likes structure and specificity: tables, schemas, templates, checklists, concrete examples
- Short, polished phrasing for external messaging
- **ML learning preferences:** Real mechanics (hypothesis, update rule, loss, optimization, assumptions, regularization)
- **Explicit equations preferred**
- SVM discussions: Lagrangian view, with/without kernel trick
- **Prefers 𝜆 for regularization**

**Achievements:**
- 3x Hackathon Champion (HUJI-ASPER, Hebrew University, International Sick Solutions)
- CVBoost: AI-driven resume analysis tool (full-stack)
- Runline: Emotional, design-led product

**Tools & Tech:**
- Scala, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, C++, Java
- React, Next.js, Node.js, Flask, Redux, Tailwind
- AWS (EC2, S3, SQS, SES), Azure (Serverless, Application Insights), Docker, Kubernetes
- MongoDB, Redis, SQL, Kafka, Grafana, Git

**Summary (Tomer's words):**
> I am Tomer. I build. I care about craft and outcomes. I'm combining product taste with hard engineering to create things people actually want. Runline is my emotional, design-led product. My AI startup direction is operationally serious. Capture real production data safely. Turn it into a curated dataset. Fine-tune open models. Prove quality with evaluation gates. Deploy with one click. Cut costs hard without users noticing.
